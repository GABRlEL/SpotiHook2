    <h1>SpotiHook v2</h1>
</div>

An attempt at simplifying XSpotify's old code by removing unnecessary ASM code, using MinHook to detour the functions.

This is just a hook that skips advertisements, I don't condone copyright infringement and therefore there is no song downloading functionality.

I am currently using this to save a history of my listened songs because I have a very short memory and I tend to forget the name of the songs I listen to.


## Credits where credits are due:
* The original reverse engineering was done by meik97, pr8x and fortender. I updated the prototypes and the offsets to work with the latest version.
